/**************************************************************************************************
* Name :								Midna Style (MidSt)										         
* Authors :						   			   Midna
* Date :									 1/29/2023
* Purpose :  To explain my personal coding format, particularly with my odd headers and comments 
						       used due to my aesthetic preferences
* Version :										1.0
**************************************************************************************************/

*	Tabs should be used when applicable for spacing, and they should be set to 4 spaces for 
proper rendering.
*	Beginning with the header, it should have buffer lines that are 99 characters long, with 98 
*'s  and 1 / at the beginning top and at the ending bottom, in order to denote it as a multiple 
line comment. In some programming languages that is not an option and any substitute characters 
are acceptable, like using 99 #'s on both sides in python.
*	The header should always contain the name of the file, the Author(s), the date last edited, 
a description as to the files purpose, and a version number to track the file. These should all
have left aligned denotations and then have the text with the actual information centered after.
Text that is centered should be centered in relation to the total characters 99, not in relation
to the white space after the denotation.
*	The header also denotes the longest line that should appear within the code, at 99 characters
long, after 99 characters it is recommended that you break the line into many.

/***************************************
* I value the aesthetics highly when it
	comes to anything.
* Correct spelling is recommended! 
***************************************/

*	Comments should appear like this, with a 40 character buffer to contain itself and comments 
requiring multiple lines simply being given a new line and a tab.
*	New thoughts that are going to the same region of code should be denoted with a new * at the
start of the comment within the comment block and a space afterwards!
*	Comments should be one level of indentation lower than what they are commenting on, when
possible, to help the comments stand out more.

/***************************************
* Acronyms are my favored way to name 
	things, and while i like to make 
	them start with Mid, that is 
	because my name is Midna and i do 
	not recommend you do the same
* This is the most subjective part of 
	this style guide, the rest works 
	without it
***************************************/
*	When creating an acronym, try to make it spell something out and look and sound unique. make
the first letter of each word capitalized and follow along the word, making subsequent letters
lowercase until another word is included.
*	Acronyms should be personalized, let them reflect a sillier light on things! not everything
has to be professional and a good acronym is memorable.

/***************************************
* {} are called braces! I called them
	curvy brackets for far too long
***************************************/
*	opening braces should be placed at the start of the line whiched called them, and closing
braces should get their own line.
